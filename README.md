# Matrix-Lifecode
Android APP based on Human Design for personal growth.
It is for use of developers which are developing in B4a and want to write astrology Apps for Android.
You need to load the development environment from https://www.b4x.com/ and install or mark all of the shown libraries.

The SWE_LIB is a ported lib from Thomas Mack (special thanks to him) from the Swiss Ephemeris lib (thanks to Alois Treindl).
I put the external libs in the folder /library. They have to be copied in the external library folder from B4A.
